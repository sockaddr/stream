# This can be useful if the FCoE device is not listed by path in /etc/fstab
# (ie. /dev/by-path/fc-*) but LVM volumes on the FCoE device are.
# The fcoe service does not know what devices will be attached, but we need a
# delay for them to be ready before LVM volume scanning.  Increasing this can
# help if mounts of LVM logical volumes on FCoE devices are failing at startup.
